This unit test was made mainly to make sure SLScommon does not crash.
The results have not been checked by hand to see if they are correct.
While it is in principle possible to make a unit test for SLSCommon, and one was performed when it was first created, no 'proper' unit test has been made for it as of Nov 10th 2020.

This test is designed such that SLSUnique cannot solve it, and such that either SLSCommon or a finisher is needed.

In the future, perhaps somebody can solve it by hand and also create some slsFinisher unit tests based on this directory.
