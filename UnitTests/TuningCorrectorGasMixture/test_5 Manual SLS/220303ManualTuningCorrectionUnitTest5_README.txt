Unit Test: test_5.py

Test_5 Quick Summary:              (Note: It's better to read this "README" file then to read the ProcDoc)

0)	Unit test_5.py is a direct copy of test_1.py. Note, test_1.py was altered to allow the Unit Test to correctly compare the manually calculated scaled concentrations to the MSRESOLVE solved scaled concetrations
	Note: test_5.turnedOff and test_1.turnedOff must be converted back into Python files (test_5.py and test_1.py). Both test_5 and test_1 are saved as turned off files to prevent errors when running a Unit Test.

1)	We now look into test_5.py to specify what is our Nist refernce pattern. The Nist reference pattern can be shown in "LiteratureReference.tsv"

2)	In gas mixture tuning corrector, a simulated spectrum for the mixture is required based on the literature spectra and the knonw concetrations. The known concetrations where aquired from the "UserInputGasMixture.py" file. Using all intensities from our scaled Nist refernce pattern, we can now input this data into Madix & Ko to get the correction factors for simulation. Now we will aquire our Simulated Spectrum that will be used for tuning correction. We will first take "LiteratureReference.tsv" and scale it to 100. This can be shown in "LiteratureReference_Scaled_100". The simulated spectrum would emcumpus all mass fragments from the molecules. However if someone is doing SLS and already knows which masses will be used then only those signals need to be simulated. We will then consider our chosen mass fragments already chosen by MSRESOLVE SLS from the previouly ran test_5.py file ("ExportedSLSUniqueMoleculesAndChosenMassFragments.tsv"). This file will be renamed "SLSOrderAndChosenMassFragments.xlsx". This can be seen in the "MadixKoMS_TuningCorrector_Gas_Mixture.xlsx" file. Using the intensities from the Scaled Nist pattern (LiteratureReference_Scaled_100.tsv"), the correction factors from Madix and Ko ("MadixKoMS_TuningCorrector_Gas_Mixture.xlsx"), the chosen mass fragments, and our known concetrations, we can now create a simulated pattern. This can be viewed in "Simulated_Spectra_Creation.xlsx". 
	This simulated spectra created in the "Simulated_Spectra_Creation.xlsx" can be seen in "Simulated Spectra.xlsx"

3)  	We will now aquire our polynomial fit for tuning correction. We will take our measured data spectra from "Collected_Data.csv" and our simulated spectra scaled to 100 (This can be viewed in "SimulatedSpectra_Scaled_100.xlsx") to create our polynomial fit. The creationg of the polynomial fit can be viewed in "GasMixturePolynomialFit.xlsx".
	
4)	We then take our polynomial fit from "GasMixturePolynomialFit.xlsx", and apply it to the Nist pattern of 1Butanal from the file "LiteratureReference_Scaled_100.tsv". This can be viewed in the "TuningCorrecting1Butanal.xlsx" file.

5)	Now we can create our mixed reference pattern. Using our measured reference data (Can be viewed in "ExportedReferencePatternOriginal.tsv") and our Nist tuning corrected 1Butanal, we can combine the two files to create our mixed pattern. This can be viewed in the 'MixedRef.tsv" file.

6)	We must now aquire our new correction factors that will include the Nist Tuning Corrected 1Butanal pattern. Using the "MadixKoMS_TuningCorrector_Gas_Mixture.xlsx" file as a reference, we will input the mixed reference pattern data from "Mixed_Ref.tsv" (we will also need the chosen mass fragments from the "SLSOrderAndChosenMassFragments.xlsx" file). This can be viewed in the "MadixKoMS_TuningCorrector_Gas_Mixture_TC_1Butanal.xlsx" file. 

7)	We now have all the data needed to perform manual SLS. We have our Mixed reference pattern ("MixedRef.tsv") that will provide us with the intensities each molecule contributes to each mass. We also have our correction factors for each molecule and its chosen mass fragment for SLS solving ("MadixKoMS_TuningCorrector_Gas_Mixture_TC_1Butanal"). Lasly, we have our molecule solving order and chosen mass fragment from "SLSOrderAndChosenMassFragments.tsv". We can now perform manual SLS which can be viewed in the "UserInputGasMixture_Manual_SLS.xlsx" file.
	We can the compare the manually calculated scaled concetrations from the "UserInputGasMixture_Manual_SLS.xlsx" file to the scaled concentrations calculated by MSRESOLVE in the "ScaledConcentrations.tsv" file.
