1. Unit test for inverse combinations with some unsolvable combination
  Note: Ashi found that this can be accomplished with RawThresholdSignalFilter of 0.4 or something like that and our default data input file. But SLS still works in that situation.

2. Search for a function that removes rows. (like keep only selected yyyy columns)

3. Add to GitHub guide about:
  Potentially add discussion of syncing with forks 
    Chosen to use this
    Needs to be added
  Revise after receiving update on process workflow
    Fix flowchart
  Split into Owner Guide and Contributor Guide
  
4. Check if Brute Force and Interpolater use the same variable, make sure it isn’t hard-coded to 2
  Investigate Specifications in Brute,  rename to bruteSpecifications if it isn’t used anywhere else
  
5. The First Time User tutorial needs an update. It might also be useful for it to be rewritten as a quickstart guide, so that first time users can see the program being run in under 5 min of their time. 

6. Figure out how Brute will scale, 
  At what point, is it useful for the program to switch to brute, rather than to inverse
  Try some trials
  Look at chris’ paper
